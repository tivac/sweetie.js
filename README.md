Sweetie is a BDD test runner, inspired by Mocha but written to be as simple as possible. It doesn't have any fancy reporters, it doesn't support 95% of what Mocha does, it just sets up a series of tests & suites and runs them.

It's probably not something you want but it's well-tested and simple to hack on!
